# Setups
This repository will be used to test linux setups with tools that catch my attention. Every branch will be a diferent setup, so they may never merge but they will be used as base to new settings.

## Base image
So this is the basic setup, the things I am sure will be necessary on any new environment I would use.

## Running

```shell
docker build . -t env_test
docker run -ti env_test
```
